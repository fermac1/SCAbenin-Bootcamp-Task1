            JavaScript can be used to change HTML content using the method <b>getElementById() or getElementByClassName()</b>.
            This method is used to find an HTML element with a specified <b>Id</b> or <b>Class Name</b> 
            either to change the element content, style or HTML Attribute Value.
            It can also be used to hide and show HTML element changing the display style.
        </div>

        <div class="second">
            For internal scripting, a script tag is used <b>&lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</b>
            where the JavaScript code is inserted between the opening and closing tag.
            This can be placed in the &lt;head&gt; or &lt;body&gt; section of an HTML page.
            Scripts can also be placed in external files with file extension <b>.js</b>,
            where the name of the script file is placed in the <b>src</b> attribute of the script tag.
            Syntax:
            <b>&lt;script src=""&gt; &lt;/script&gt;</b>
            <ul>
            The advantage of external scripts over internal scripts:
            <li>It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read</li>
            <li>Several script files can be added to one page</li>

            </ul>
            JavaScript functions are blocks of code that are executed when called.
        </div>

        <div class="first">
            JavaScript can display data in different ways: <b>innerHTML</b> which writes into an HTML element, 
            <b>document.write()</b> which writes into HTML output, <b>window.alert()</b> which writes into an alert box
            and <b>console.log()</b> which writes into the browser console for the purpose of debuggging. <br>

            Using <b>document.write()</b> when an HTML document is loaded will delete all existing HTML.
            So it is advised to use only when testing.
        </div>

        <div class="second">
            JavaScript program is a list of programming statement and this statements are composed of 
            keywords, values, operators, expressions, comments.<br>
            This statement often start with a keyword which identifies the action to be performed.<br>
            JavaScript ignores white spaces but they can be used to make the code readable.

        </div>

        <div class="first">
            JavaScript syntax is the set of rules on how JavaScript programs are constructed.
            It defines two types of values: Fixed values and Variable values.
            The Fixed values are called literals while the Variable values are called variables.<br>

            JavaScript expression is a combination of values, variables and operators which compute to a value.<br>

            JavaScript comments are statements that are not executed. They begin with either a <b>//</b> or 
            written between <b>/* */</b>
            <ul>
                <li>They can be used to explain JavaScript code and make it more readable.</li>
                <li>They can also be used to prevent execution while testing an alternative code.</li>
                <li>Single line comments start with <b>//</b></li>
                <li>Multi-line comments start with <b>/*</b> and ends with <b>*/</b></li>
            </ul>
            
            JavaScript Identifiers are used to name variables, keywords, functions and labels.
            
            The first character must be a letter, underscore(_) or dollar sign($). Numbers are not allowed as first character.
            
            JavaScript is Case Sensitive.<br>

            When joining multiple words into one variable name, hyphens(-) are not allowed.
            Underscore and Camel case are used instead.

        </div>
    
        <div class="second">
            JavaScript Variables are containers for storing data values.<br>
            <b>
                var productName = Nivea;
            </b><br>
            The above syntax simply means the variable <b>productName</b> is being declared and the assignement operator (=) assigns a value to it.
            If a value isn't assigned then the variable <b>productName</b> is <b>Undefined.</b>

            <p> Assignment operator can also be attached to this operators where the assignment operator comes after the operator itself.<br>
                For example:<br>
                <b> x += y</b> this is also the same as <b> x = x + y</b><br><br>
                The <b>+</b> operator can also be used to concatenate strings.

        The numbers in an arithmetic operation are called Operands.
        Operator precedence describes the order in which an expression is executed.
        Multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. 
        When a parentheses is used, the operation inside the parentheses is computed first.
